# AiBallPitSwimmer
 An exploration into 2D swimming with AI, using the matter.js physics engine.

Main concept is a 2D simulated space in which an agent would consist of several rectangular "limbs", (simulated rectangles held together by joints at key connections in a stick man fashion),

The reward function being how far he can go, and his outputs being a torque force he can extert unto certain limbs.

Status: Get working simulation

Steps for the future:
1. implement ai
2. implement ui
3. implement data i/o (read/write) for extended training
4. publish findings here

Complete:
1. Main game loop, working w/ out Ai
